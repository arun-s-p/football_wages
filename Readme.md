## Football wages
The objective of the project was to assess how accurately the wages of football players reflect their performance on the pitch. The problem is to develop a model for wage prediction as a function of key performance indicators. By making use of the data available in public sphere, the performance indicators that correlate with the team's results are identified as meaningful contributions from the players towards team's success. Using these indicators a multiple polynomial regression model for the player's wage is developed. The transparency of a regression model against a neural network allows the stakeholders to determine the importance of individual performance indicators which can be tweaked according to the preferred playing system of a particular team. 
However, a gradient boosting regressor is found to be better than the multiple regression model.
The outcome of the project is performance based wage model which can be used by stakeholders as a starting point, while being fully aware of the fact that higher wages is normal in the industry, during contract negotiations.
